1. Introduction
Google CL aims to bring management of your Google services to the command line. Currently, the only Google services supported are Picasa, Blogger, and YouTube.

2. Example usage
Here are some examples for this wonderful tool!

Launch interactive mode. The only difference between this mode and the command line is that you don't have to keep typing "google-cl.py"
$ ./google-cl.py

The rest of these examples assume you're in interactive mode and therefore omit the "./google-cl.py".

Create a photo album with tags "Vermont" and name "Summer Vacation 2009"
> picasa create -n "Summer Vacation 2009" -t Vermont ~/photos/vacation2009/*
  
Post photos to an existing album
> picasa post -n "Summer Vacation 2008" ~/old_photos/*.jpg
  
Download another user's albums whose titles match a regular expression
> picasa get --user my.friend.joe --title ".*ponies.*" ~/photos/joes_pony
  
Delete some posts you accidentally put up
> blogger delete -n "Silly post, number [0-9]*"
  
Upload that post you wrote while deep underground
> blogger post -n "My adventures in mining" -t "mines, Internet-less existence, darkness" ~/blog_entries/mining.txt

Post your latest film endeavor to YouTube
> youtube post --category Film --tags "Jane Austen, zombies" ~/final_project.mp4

Tag all your robot videos as such
> youtube tag -n ".*robot.*" -t robot

List the albums that your friend has (See below for more info on the list task)
> picasa list title,url -u friend.username

List your events for a given week
> calendar list --date 2010-05-25,2010-06-02

3. The 'list' task
The list task can be given additional arguments to specify what exactly is being listed. For example,

> <service> list style1,style2,style3

will output those styles, in that order, with a comma delimiter. Valid values for <style1> etc. are:
	'title' - title of the entry.
	'url' - treated as 'url-direct' or 'url-site' depending on setting in preferences file.
	'url-site' - url of the site associated with the entry.
	'url-direct' - url directly to the resource.
	'author' - author(s) of the entry.

The difference between 'url-site' and 'url-direct' is best exemplified by a picasa PhotoEntry: 'url-site' gives a link to the photo in the user's album, 'url-direct' gives a link to the image url. If 'url-direct' is specified but is not applicable, 'url-site' is placed in its stead, and vice-versa.
