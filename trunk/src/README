Google CL aims to bring management of your Google services to the command line. Currently, the only Google services supported are Picasa, Blogger, and YouTube.

Here are some examples for this wonderful tool!

Launch interactive mode. The only difference between this mode and the command line is that you don't have to keep typing "google-cl.py"
$ ./google-cl.py

The rest of these examples assume you're in interactive mode and therefore omit the "./google-cl.py".

Create a photo album with tags "Vermont" and name "Summer Vacation 2009"
> picasa create -n "Summer Vacation 2009" -t Vermont ~/photos/vacation2009/*
  
Post photos to an existing album
> picasa post -n "Summer Vacation 2008" ~/old_photos/*.jpg
  
Download another user's albums whose titles match a regular expression
> picasa get --user my.friend.joe --title ".*ponies.*" ~/photos/joes_pony
  
Delete some posts you accidentally put up
> blogger delete -n "Silly post, number [0-9]*"
  
Upload that post you wrote while deep underground
> blogger post -n "My adventures in mining" -t "mines, Internet-less existence, darkness" ~/blog_entries/mining.txt

Post your latest film endeavor to YouTube
> youtube post --category Film --tags "Jane Austen, zombies" ~/final_project.mp4

Tag all your robot videos as such
> youtube tag -n ".*robot.*" -t robot
