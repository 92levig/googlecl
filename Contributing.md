#summary How to contribute to GoogleCL

## Using ##
The easiest way to help is to use the program and file an [issue](http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/issues/list) when you find something that seems amiss. You can also give less structured feedback on the [Discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/googlecl-discuss)

## Developing ##
The easiest way to contribute code is to find (or submit) an issue in the [Issues Tracker](http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/issues/list), write code that addresses the issue, then upload a subversion diff that patches the issue using upload-diff.py, included in the trunk of the repository. Be sure to check out the [Discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/googlecl-discuss) and [StyleGuide](StyleGuide.md)

Before we can use your patch, though, you have to sign something.
  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work to Google Data Python Client Library, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html)
