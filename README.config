Your configuration/preferences file is located in ~/.googlecl/config.
You can also specify a file with the --config option.

1. SECTIONS
PICASA: Options specific to the Picasa service.
DOCS: Options specific to the Docs service.
GENERAL: Options general to most or all services.

2. OPTIONS
Each option description follows the format <name>: [<values>], <description>

2.1 All sections
2.1.1 Description
Each of these values can be found in any section. The service being run will try to find the option in its own section, and failing that, in the GENERAL section.
2.1.2 Options
list_style: [<style>,<style>,...] Comma-separated (no spaces) list of attributes to print out when using the 'list' task and no styles are specified on the command line. For a list of styles, see the README.
<option>: [<string>], You can specify any option in the config file to use as a "general" case. When a command-line option is required (for example the username, or the title of an album created with Picasa), and nothing is passed in via the command line, this value will be used.
cap_results: [True, False], Cap the number of results to max_results. (That is, queries will only return one feed).
max_results: [<integer>], Maximum number of results / entries to return. Sets the max-results query parameter of the uri. You can use this with cap_results to limit the amount of data being sent over the network.
regex: [True, False], Use regular expressions in matching titles.
delete_prompt: [True, False], Prompt to confirm deletion of items.
tags_prompt: [True, False], Prompt for tags for each item being uploaded. (Not fully implemented).

2.2 PICASA
access: [public, private, protected], The default access level of the albums you create. Public means visible to all, private means unlisted, protected means sign-in required to view the album.

2.3 DOCS
xxx_format: [<extension>], The extension to use for a type of document. The types of document are document, spreadsheet, and presentation. PDF files automatically use 'pdf' as the extension
xxx_editor: [<editor>], The editor to use for a type of document. The types of document are the same as the xxx_format option, plus pdf_editor in case you have a pdf editor.
format: [<extension>], The extension to use by default if the document type is not defined by an xxx_format option.
editor: [<editor>], The editor to use by default if the document type is not defined by an xxx_editor option. If this is not defined, will use the EDITOR environment variable instead.
decode_utf_8: [True,False], When you retrieve docs from the server, you can have GoogleCL try to decode them from UTF-8 immediately. Most users will not need to worry about this, but it's handy if you have an application sensitive to unicode characters such as `less` or `tex`.

2.4 GENERAL
url_style: [site, direct], Which sub-style to use for listing urls. Site will typically put you at the website, while direct is usually a link directly to the resource.
missing_field_value: [<string>] Placeholder string to use when listing an invalid attribute, for example, the url of a contact.
date_print_format: [<format string>] Format to use when printing date information. See the Python "time" documentation for formats (http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.strftime). For example: "%m %d at %H" for "<month> <day> at <hour>"
auth_browser: [<browser>] Browser to launch when authenticating the OAuth request token. You should only need to authenticate to each service once.
delete_by_default: [True, False], When prompted to confirm deletion of an object, hitting enter directly will confirm the delete.
