Install the gdata python client library if you have not already.
The project home page is here: http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/

Short instructions:
$ sudo python setup.py install

or

$ python setup.py install --home=~
and set your PYTHONPATH to include your home directory.

For more detailed instructions, I recommend looking at the gdata-python-client
INSTALL.txt file. It has instructions on installing python and modifying
PYTHONPATH
