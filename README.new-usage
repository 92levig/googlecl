version 0.9.11
  * --force-auth and --skip-auth will let you specify if GoogleCL should verify the oauth access token it has on file for the service being used. After the first valid access token retrieved, --skip-auth is set in your config file as True. You can set this value to False to force a validation step on every run. The validation step is an authenticated request to Google to retrieve a small amount of data -- removing this step can yield a significant decrease in execution time for slow connections.

version 0.9.10
	* List "styles" have been renamed to list "fields". If you have a custom list_style entry in your config file, rename it to list_fields to make it work again.
	* v2 and v3 support for gdata for the average user means that you can now see and download non-converted files that you've uploaded through the web interface, and list more details about your contacts. See the README section on the list task.
  * Config file option force_gdata_v1 lets you use the older versions in the library written for Docs and Contacts. The primary purpose of this option is to avoid copying and pasting a verification code from the browser into GoogleCL. It means that you won't benefit from any v2 / v3 upgrades to GoogleCL like the ones mentioned before.
  * Started following the XDG Base Directory Specification (http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html). GoogleCL will still look for config files and access tokens in the old directory (~/.googlecl), but may not in the future.
