Steps that we take when doing a new tarball release (so we don't forget)

1) Be sure changelog is up to date. Check the commit messages for important bug fixes, enhancements, features, etc.
2) Increment version number in changelog (change "svn HEAD" to "version x.x.x")
3) Be sure man pages are up to date.
4) Update VERSION variable in src/google
5) Regenerate man pages (or carefully search and replace old version number with new one).
6) Commit all these changes with a message like "Change to x.x.x" or "Commiting updated version numbers x.x.x"
7) Use svn copy to tag the release:
 $ svn copy http://googlecl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk http://googlecl.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-x.x.x -m "x.x.x release"
8) Use either "python setup.py sdist" to create the tarball, or tar up the trunk as googlecl-x.x.x.tar.gz. Just watch out for files like this one when you use thelatter :)
